  Aries: {
    Sun: "Aries is an active, energetic sign. People with Sun in Aries are direct, \n                     straightforward, and uncomplicated. They expect the same from others, \n                     and are baffled when they don’t always get it.",
    Moon: "They live in the moment and have a hard time waiting for things to happen. \n                     Whims of the moment take absolute precedence in their lives.",
    Mercury: "Mercury in Aries communicators make quick decisions–so quick that you \n                     might think they don’t much like thinking things over. The truth is, Aries \n                     communicators don’t have a lot of patience for mulling. \n                     Their decisions are often driven by the need for instant gratification.",
    Venus: "Venus in Aries people flirt by being up-front, direct, and even daring. \n                     They try to win you over by expressing how enterprising and independent \n                     they are.",
    Mars: "This is a very impulsive position of Mars. The first instinct for Mars in \n                     Aries natives is to take action. Quick flare-ups characterize the Mars \n                     in Aries character, but their anger usually doesn’t last for too long.",
    Uranus: "People with a Uranus in Aries placement search for what is new and out of \n                     the ordinary, but are prone to foolhardiness and can be extremely eccentric.",
    Jupiter: "There's a belief in the power of positivity, that life is what you make of it. \n                     Loves competition, doing things independently. Values instant results. \n                     Attracts the most good fortune when he/she takes the lead, initiates, inspires, and demonstrates enthusiasm and courage.",
    Saturn: "While Saturn in Aries may cause a delayed development of ambition in their life, \n                     they may end up taking on a lot of responsibility when still very young. \n                     Obstacles arise that may block progress. Having to assert \n                     themselves can cause a lot of anxiety. Anger may be an issue, \n                     although others see them as controlled and cool the majority of the time."
    },
  Taurus: {
    Sun: "Taurus natives are sensual folk–and this includes sex, but extends to pleasures in \n                     all areas: they delight in the sensual pleasures of food, a comfortable blanket, \n                     a richly colored aquarium to look at, the smell of flowers or spring rain, \n                     pleasing melodies coming from their stereos, and so forth. Though they are dependable \n                     most of the time, this generally shows itself more in habit than in outright helpfulness.",
    Moon: "Familiarity is important to Lunar Taureans. These people are earthy and strong-willed. \n                     They feel with their senses and they are pretty much rooted in their ways.",
    Mercury: "Mercury in Taurus natives are plodders. They may take their time to arrive at a decision, \n                     but they get there — they are actually quite decisive, even stubborn with their opinions.",
    Venus: "Love for Venus in Taurus centers on the physical world and creature comforts — they revel \n                     in sensual surroundings. These people project themselves as solid and comfortable.",
    Mars: "“Slow and steady wins the race” could easily be a motto for Mars in Taurus. These goal-oriented \n                     people are not known for their speed, but their staying power is tremendous.",
    Uranus: "There is a clash here between oppising tendencies. Fixed Taurus wants to sit still while \n                     Uranus wants to break free from all conventions. A person with this placement is stubborn and brilliant.",
    Jupiter: "There is a delight in sensual pleasures and wants the good life. A strong feeling of what they \n                     want is worth attracts success. Good instincts for finances, \n                     what things are worth/good products, and investing. Attracts the most good fortune when \n                     he/she is charitable, generous but discriminating, and patient. Watch for over-indulgence.",
    Saturn: "Saturn in Taurus has a deep need to feel secure; both emotionally and financially. \n                     They like to keep a strict control over their daily tasks. Unfortunately for them, \n                     nothing comes easy. They have to work hard for everything they get."

  Gemini: {
    Sun: "With the Sun in Gemini, the urge for self-expression is strong. These natives are often just \n                     as interested in collecting information as they are in sharing it. \n                     Curious to a fault, Geminis have a finger in every pie. ",
    Moon: "Lunar Geminis are usually pleasant, witty, and charming people. At home and with family, however, \n                     they can be moody and irritable at times.",
    Mercury: "Mercury in Gemini people are generally quick-witted. They can come across as somewhat scattered, \n                     and this is mainly due to their eclectic interests. They seem \n                     to know a little about everything.",
    Venus: "Venus in Gemini people will try to win over the object of their affection with witty conversation, \n                     displaying just how much they “know”, and demonstrating their diverse interests. These lovers are playful — some might even call them a tease.",
    Mars: "When Mars in Gemini natives get angry or fired up, they use words as their “weapon”. Angry words–some \n                     of the most incisive and sarcastic ones–can fly around \n                     with the more energetic natives.",
    Uranus: "Brimming with original ideas, Uranus in Gemini is great at creating and carrying out work, but can \n                     voccasionally become restless.",
    Jupiter: "There is an attraction to good fortune if a person with this placement uses their wit and ingeniousness, \n                     is versatile, sociable, curious, and puts others at \n                     ease with friendliness and sincere curiosity. Values the intellect \n                     and sees opportunities to grow and succeed through intellectual, verbal, and written channels. \n                     Believes that intelligence and knowledge are the keys to solving problems.",
    Saturn: "Saturn in Gemini can adapt to different situations easily, using a systematic and logical approach. \n                     They are cool and rational in the face of adversity. \n                     They have excellent powers of reasoning, so they do well in mathematics and science."
  },
  Cancer: {
    Sun: "Sun in Cancer natives have a strong survival instinct. They are protective of \n                     those they care about, and of themselves too. They are often quite reticent \n                     about sharing their inner selves with the rest of the world, and are often \n                     caught up in reminiscence.",
    Moon: "Moon in Cancer people are never detached — they cling to things, their home,\n                      and people they care for. They seek out security and familiarity in all they do. \n                     They look for peace and quiet.",
    Mercury: "These people communicate with feeling, conveying a sensitive, withdrawn, \n                     and thoughtful nature to the people they interact with. If this is the only \n                     personal planet in Cancer in their chart, they may come across as more personal \n                     and sensitive than they actually are.",
    Venus: "Love for Venus in Cancer is best when it is committed and rather predictable. \n                     These people are sensitive in love, even if their Sun sign is the more playful \n                     and outgoing signs of Gemini or Leo.",
    Mars: "This position inclines toward passive-aggressiveness. These people seem to resist \n                     change and to shy away from direct confrontations. They need to feel secure before they act.",
    Uranus: "Cancers moodiness combined with the unpredictability of Uranus sometimes causes \n                     problems. The imagination is enhanced, but not always certain of what it wants.",
    Jupiter: "This placement encourages sympathy, and promotes the ability to comforts other. \n                     Values tradition and works towards security. Relies most on gut instincts \n                     when it comes to pursuing goals and business success.",
    Saturn: "Saturn in Cancer is not very emotionally demonstrative. They prefer to hide their \n                     inner thoughts and feelings. Home and family is of utmost importance. \n                     They often give up other opportunities to take care of their family. \n                     They often have a strong bond with their family members, though they have trouble expressing it. \n                     Life lessons include learning to feel empathy and the value of responsibility."

  Leo: {
    Uranus: "Incredible energy and boldness makes anyone with this placement extremely confident \n                     with a power-hungry streak.",
    Pluto: "Pluto stays in a sign for 14-30 years, meaning its effects are generational like Uranus and Neptune. \n                     When Pluto is in Leo, the goal is transformation \n                     towards actualization.",
    Jupiter: "This placement understands that generosity brings success. There is a magnanimity \n                     and generosity that inspires others to act with dignity and sincerity.",
    Saturn: "Leo Saturn can undermine their goals by undervaluing themselves. This attitude of \n                     inferiority can sabotage all they work towards. Their feelings of \n                     jealousy and lack of spontaneity can push others away. They often put up a \n                     coldness towards others to protect themselves emotionally. Their challenge is to connect with others \n                     and find value within themselves.",
    Sun: "There’s an unmistakably regal air to Solar Leos. These are dignified–even noble–folk. \n                     Leos have a reputation for being conceited, but think again. \n                     Leos do feel important, but this generally takes the form of wanting to change \n                     the world in some way–to make the world a better place. They are generally motivated by affection for people.",
    Moon: "Lunar Leos often feel a need to organize, and even control, their families and friends. \n                     They have an inner mission to set things right, and generally \n                     like to oversee the goings-on in their little circle.",
    Mercury: "When Mercury in Leo people speak, they do it with authority. Some of them come across \n                     as know-it-alls, but the more mature ones speak with style. \n                     They want others to know about their presence of mind and their know-how.",
    Venus: "Venus in Leo loves to court and be courted, and they need to feel very special. They are \n                     warm, generous, and even grand. Though really quite loyal to \n                     their partners (remember that love is THE most important thing in Leo’s life), \n                     they thrive on romantic attention.",
    Mars: "This position of Mars gives a drive for significance. Mars in Leo individuals possess a strong \n                     need to create in some way and they are determined that \n                     their lives have not only meaning, but significant meaning!"

  Virgo: {
    Uranus: "This placement provides a strong intuition and will be financially succesful, enjoying working in the public eye.",
    Pluto: "Pluto stays in a sign for 14-30 years, meaning its effects are generational like Uranus and Neptune. \n                     People with Pluto in Virgo are about working within systems to \n                     create methodological change.",
    Jupiter: "Being helpful, honest, orderly, and detail oriented are natural for someone with this placement. \n                     Practical and technical knowledge and skills are most valued.",
    Saturn: "Virgo Saturn shuns the limelight. Shy and reserved, they are timid in public. They may have \n                     obsessive compulsive traits or fears to deal with. Routine and order are \n                     important components in their lives. They may get so caught up in the \n                     details, however that they lose sight of the big picture.",
    Sun: "Virgo people are generally respectable, hard-working individuals who have a love of knowledge \n                     and know-how.Virgo’s symbol, the Virgin, shows itself in the lives of Virgos through \n                     a love of all that is “natural” and a certain purity of \n                     spirit that keeps Virgos self-sufficient and self-contained, at least on the surface.",
    Moon: "Lunar Virgos find security in the little things in life. They feel most content when they’ve \n                     straightened out all the details of everyday life.",
    Mercury: "Mercury in Virgo people are rarely flashy in their communication style, but they do \n                     thoroughly appreciate it when others acknowledge their brainpower. These people love to \n                     keep track of all the details.",
    Venus: "Venus in Virgo people are not the flirtatious sort. Instead, their appeal lies in their dedication, \n                     their willingness to work on the relationship, and to make the relationship work in real terms.",
    Mars: "Most Mars in Virgo natives are not particularly aggressive by nature. Although they can be a \n                     little hard-nosed and critical at times, they rarely resort to pushing others around. \n                     Still, an annoyed Mars in Virgo native can be difficult to be around!",

Generally quite eager \n                     to cooperate, Librans spend a lot of their time trying not to rock the boat.",
    Pluto: "Pluto stays in a sign for 14-30 years, meaning its effects are generational like Uranus and Neptune. \n                     People with Pluto in Libra are all about restoring peace and balance on a \n                     societal level.",
    Jupiter: "Jupiter in Libra loves people, and this will bring them much good fortune. Their natural \n                     diplomacy lets them interact with others and solve problems. If they can develop a \n                     strong sense of self, their luck grows stronger. This allows them \n                     to care less what others think of them.",
    Saturn: "Saturn in Libra must learn how to relate to other people on a personal and social level. \n                     They need to take responsibility for their actions in relationships. It lies entirely \n                     in their hands whether a relationship will be the source of growth \n                     or suffering. If they are receptive, reliable, tactful and organized, \n                     they could gain status and wealth.",
    Moon: "Moon in Libra people have a strong need for partnership. Without someone to share their lives with, \n                     they feel utterly incomplete. This is why many people with this position get \n                     involved in marriages or living-together arrangements quite young.",
    Mercury: "Libra communicators come across as very pleasing. Diplomacy comes naturally to these natives. \n                     At the very least, they take many pains to be diplomatic.",
    Venus: "Venus in Libra people will try to impress you with their kindness, evenhandedness, and willingness \n                     to make your relationship work. They have a polished manner in love, which \n                     sometimes makes them appear insincere or superficial. They are gentle \n                     lovers who hate to be offended.",
    Mars: "Mars in Libra natives often reflect about things before they act. Decisiveness is not their strong point, \n                     but they do, eventually, get things done. Many people with this \n                     position procrastinate, generally because they feel the need to weigh all \n                     of the alternatives before taking action.",

    Saturn: "Saturn in Scorpio is impatient. They demand a lot from themselves and from those around them.

Full of willpower and energy,\n                     they are so determined to meet their goals it is hard for them to remain calm.",

No matter what, there is something very intense about \n                     Lunar Scorpios. Their ability to see what isn't obvious \n                     to the rest of the world can be intimidating or wildly attractive, \n                     depending on the audience.",

    Saturn: "Sagittarius Saturn is conservative, and they change only with much resistance. They may be very \n                     narrow-minded when it comes to philosophy or religion. With Saturn in \n                     Sagittarius, it gains structure and goals. They love to \n                     learn and now they have the focus they need.

    Saturn: "Saturn in Capricorn is very cautious and detail-oriented. They can be very charming or persistent \n                     when they want something. They are gifted with persuasion, and may make an \n                     effective speaker. They are fair and impartial. They have great \n                     foresight, and are gifted with practical matters. \n                     Some will be concerned with developing prestige. They have a \n                     strong sense of duty, but don't always find joy in accomplishing their task. They may find fulfillment in service to others.",
    Moon: "Being useful and productive are basic needs for Lunar Capricorns. Because they generally keep their \n                     emotions under check, Moon in Capricorn people come across as competent people.",
    Mercury: "With Mercury in Capricorn, natives have a strong need to compartmentalize the impressions they \n                     get from the world. These people often speak and write in a slow and methodical manner.\n                     They appreciate structure and order.",
    Venus: "Venus in Capricorn people will try to win your heart by displaying self-control, presence of mind, \n                     and responsible behavior. These lovers want you to know they are goal-oriented,\n                     witty, savvy, and controlled. Nobody can get the best of them.",
    Mars: "With fiery Mars in the more orderly sign of Capricorn, natives with this position have a subdued and \n                     controlled style of approaching life. Most don't come across as particularly enthusiastic;\n                     rather, theirs is a low-key but determined energy.",

  Aquarius: {
    Sun: "One of the standout characteristics of those born under the Sun Sign of Aquarius is their unwillingness \n                     to follow the beaten track. With advancement and progress on their minds, there can be an \n                     irreverence to old and outdated ways of thinking and doing things.",
    Neptune: "Neptune's effects are felt generationally. Generations with Neptune in Aquarius experience a social \n                     atmosphere of hightened intellect and unconventional connectivity.",
    Uranus: "Aquarius Uranus likes to socialize, and they are naturals at networking. They love to be where the \n                     action is. Highly inventive, they can envision what will happen down the road. They can \n                     understand complicated social problems and come up with ideas to help ease them.",
    Jupiter: "Luck finds Jupiter in Aquarius through their use of visionary ideals and innovative ideas. They \n                     can seek more luck by putting themselves in situations that place value on innovation and \n                     original thinking. To gather even more good fortune, \n                     Aquarius Jupiter needs to learn to compromise.",
    Saturn: "Saturn in Aquarius needs structure in their life, but it will be unconventional. They need a place \n                     to share their ideas, even when they are impractical or fanciful. Their big challenge is \n                     to grow while being open and fair to everyone. They can be strong, impersonal \n                     and scientific, or cold, unloving and opinionated. They may resent being told what they don't want to hear.",
    Moon: "Moon in Aquarius people are extremely observant. They are lifetime students of human nature, loving to \n                     analyze why people do what they do. This often stems from a detached–even shy–personality, \n                     especially in youth.",
    Mercury: "Unconventional in self-expression, Mercury in Aquarius natives enjoy breaking the rules. They are \n                     not necessarily loud or flamboyant people, but they often have a quiet way of stirring \n                     others up. These natives delight in exposing what they deem biases in \n                     others' way of thinking.",
    Venus: "Venus in Aquarius people try to impress you with their open-minded, future-thinking spirit. They want \n                     you to see them as unique, rebellious, and a little provocative. They are attractive \n                     when they are acting a little aloof.",
    Mars: "The tried-and-true methods of getting things done are far too boring for those born with Mars in this \n                     unique and original sign. Mars in Aquarius natives often have a rather original view \n                     of the world as well.",
  },
  Pisces: {
    Sun: "Sun in Pisces people are frequently pegged as wishy-washy, but this is all a matter of opinion. \n                     What you will find behind a vaguely directionless, spacey manner is a \n                     deep person with real dreams.",
    Neptune: "Neptune's effects are felt generationally. Generations with Neptune in see ego dissipation and \n                     a desire to see social unity.",
    Uranus: "Pisces Uranus likes fantasy and mysticism. They can be responsible for changes in religion, \n                     beliefs or morals. They have an inner wisdom if they allow it to be heard.",
    Jupiter: "Jupiter in Pisces is content to remain behind the scenes to help. They don't seek the spotlight. \n                     They are very sensitive, but easy going. They may not be very ambitious. \n                     They don't need a lot of material things to be content in life. They may \n                     closely follow a religion or mystical practices. They may be prone to being taken advantage of \n                     due to their compassionate nature. They like seclusion.",
    Saturn: "The life lesson for Saturn in Pisces is to grow in emotional understanding, humility and compassion. \n                     They feel obligated to help those less fortunate than themselves. \n                     They may need to overcome negative emotions, deep fears and a wandering imagination. \n                     They are adept in the fields of social work, medical care, teaching, religion and the arts.",
    Moon: "Lunar Pisceans are known to be dreamy and not always in touch with reality. However, though these \n                     people may not always show real-world savvy in day-to-day, practical \n                     affairs, they make up for this with remarkable intuition.",
    Mercury: "Mercury in Pisces are gentle communicators with a soft touch that is pleasing and warm. Some of \n                     them come across in an almost poetic way. Not given to bother too \n                     much with details, these individuals tend to sponge up the feelings and moods of their environment.",
    Venus: "Venus in Pisces people project themselves as dreamy, soft-hearted partners. Everything about the \n                     way they flirt promises a lovely time. Theirs is an elusive charm — \n                     they are sweetly playful, a little moody, and perhaps a little irregular.",
    Mars: "Mild-tempered and gentle, these guys and gals move through life in a manner that can hardly be \n                     considered direct. Mars is the planet of action and assertion, \n                     and Pisces is a passive sign that rarely asserts itself in a direct fashion.",
